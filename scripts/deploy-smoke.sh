# Usage: scripts/deploy-smoke.sh <base-url> [expected-commit]
# 1. The home page answers 200 and shows HOME_MARKER.
# 2. The build marker (HEALTH_PATH) reports the expected commit. Retried while Vercel moves the
#    production alias; without an expected commit it only has to report one.
# 3. MAIN_ROUTE answers 200 and shows MAIN_MARKER.
